**Standard Operating Procedure: VoiceDNA Analysis, Application, and Glossary Reference**

---

**Purpose:**
To extract, represent, and apply a complete 36-element VoiceDNA profile to text passages using a consistent 0–4 scale. This procedure ensures uniformity across character/narrator voices and supports measurable, reusable stylistic profiles in the VoiceChem system.

---

**System Components:**

* **Input**: A text passage (\~100–200 words)
* **Output**: A 36-element VoiceDNA JSON object (0–4 level per element)
* **Engine**: Rule-based + LLM hybrid analyzer

---

**VoiceDNA Scale (0–4):**

* **0**: None (feature is absent)
* **1**: Light (barely present)
* **2**: Moderate (clearly used but not dominant)
* **3**: Strong (shapes voice consistently)
* **4**: Saturated (defines the voice)

**Process 1: Capturing a VoiceDNA from Text**

**Prompt Template:**
"""
Analyze the following passage and assign a value from **0 to 4** for each of the 36 VoiceChem elements. Each score should reflect observable linguistic behavior.

Return your output as a JSON object:
{
"Rh": 2, "Co": 1, ... (all 36 elements)
}

Passage:
\[INSERT TEXT HERE]
"""

**Guidelines:**

* Use regex, tokenization, and pattern-matching for surface/structural elements.
* Use semantic, pragmatic, and rhetorical heuristics for deep/experimental features.
* Maintain full 36-element completeness, even if many values are 0.

---

**Process 2: Applying a VoiceDNA to Text**

**Prompt Template:**
"""
Revise the following passage to match the specified **VoiceDNA profile**. Each element uses a 0–4 scale.

Follow these instructions for each element:

* Apply the effect described in the instruction table.
* Match the intensity of the feature to its level.
* If level is 0, ensure the feature is not present.
* Do not alter the meaning or plot.

VoiceDNA: { "Rh": 3, "Co": 2, ... }

\[INSERT TEXT HERE]
"""

---

**Output Requirements:**

* Preserve semantic content and character intention.
* Reflect the tone and rhythm defined by the VoiceDNA.
* Resulting style should feel consistent, distinctive, and aligned with numerical constraints.

---

**Quality Checks:**

* Visual or programmatic comparison of source vs revised formula
* Validate all 36 elements appear in output JSON
* Review edge cases (e.g., poetic texts, nonlinear structures)

---

**Version Control:**

* Use `VoiceDNA_Profiles/` for saving JSON profiles
* Save before/after texts in `VoiceChem_Rewrites/`
* Tag outputs by character, scene, narrator, or use case
