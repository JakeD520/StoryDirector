  "rawInput": "this story is about a serial killer/sweeney todd concept.  the story was originally concieved as a musical, like a rock opera, but not sure where i want it now.  the concept is that a woman moves into an apartment building where a guy who lives there becomes intrigued.  she seems nice, not too outlandish, pretty normal.  there is a goofy fun gut that lives in the apartment as well, kinda stupid dude.  anyway, murders start happening.  another character, a really sultry foxy chick seems to have the serial killer vibe, so maybe the reader suspects her.  at any rate, the main guy character is fascinated with the sultry chick, but theres always worry that maybe he is going to be murdered because the reader thinks shes the serial killer. anyway, it will eventually reveal that the new girl is the killer, and im thinking that at some point the main character falls for her, but then is almost murdered by her, because shes obsessed, and maybe is thinking like a murder suicide thing...not sure how it ends.",
