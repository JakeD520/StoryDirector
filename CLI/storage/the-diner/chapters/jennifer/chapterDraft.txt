Steve and Jared are sitting in Jared's car in the Lone Star parking lot with the windows up and the air conditioning on. They are not driving but simply talking. Steve, in the passenger seat, jokingly discusses her desire to leave the small town. Jared watches her, appreciating her animated way of speaking.

Jared suggests leaving, but Steve responds with sarcasm, expressing her disbelief about the idea of leaving without a plan. She playfully jabs Jared in the ribs, telling him off while Jared laughs. A punk rock song plays on the radio, catching Steve's attention, and she turns up the volume enthusiastically.

Steve, sitting in the passenger seat, starts dancing enthusiastically, thrilled by the moment. Jared watches her, mesmerized by how amazing she is. As Steve moves her arms, attempting to draw him into the dance, Jared laughs, makes a few subtle movements to join in, but then waves her off.

As the song ends, Jared turns down the volume. Steve's tone softens as she reveals a confession to him. She points to her nametag labeled "Steve" and admits it's not her name. She tells Jared it belonged to a former employee, using it to maintain emotional distance. Her real name is Jennifer. Jared listens attentively.

Jared observes her closely, causing her to shift uncomfortably in her seat. She feels a mix of embarrassment and slight shame. Noticing her discomfort, Jared offers her comfort.
