EXT. LONE STAR PARKING LOT – DAY

Inside a parked car, windows up and AC humming. STEVE sits in the passenger seat, animated and lively. JARED is behind the wheel, listening intently.

```
                          STEVE
      (smirking)
      I need to get out of this small town—if you could even call it that.
```

Jared chuckles, his attention fully on her expressive delivery.

```
                          JARED
      (teasing)
      Maybe you just need a bigger suitcase.
```

They sit in stillness, their laughter momentarily filling the enclosed space.

---


The car remains parked. JARED looks at STEVE, a playful spark in his eyes.

```
                          JARED
      Let’s go.
```

STEVE lets out a soft laugh.

```
                          STEVE
      Yeah, right.
```

She jabs him lightly in the ribs.

```
                          STEVE
      Fuck you, dude. Can’t you just let a girl ramble?
```

A punk rock song bursts to life from the radio. STEVE's eyes light up.

```
                          STEVE
      I love this song!
```

She quickly reaches across and cranks up the volume. Music floods the car.

---


STEVE begins to dance as much as the confines of the passenger seat allow. Her energy is infectious.

```
                          STEVE
      (grinning)
      Come on!
```

JARED watches, amused, caught between embarrassment and admiration. He offers a half-hearted shoulder wiggle.

```
                          JARED
      Alright, alright.
```

He waves her off playfully, but the grin doesn’t leave his face. STEVE keeps dancing, unapologetically alive.

---

The music fades. JARED reaches over and turns the knob, reducing the volume to a hush. STEVE’s demeanor shifts.

```
                          STEVE
      You know what...
```

Her voice is softer now. She looks down at the nametag pinned to her shirt.

```
                          STEVE
      I have a confession to make.
```

JARED turns slightly toward her, quietly curious.

```
                          JARED
      I’m listening.
```

STEVE taps the nametag.

```
                          STEVE
      Steve wasn’t my name. He worked at the diner before me.
```

She exhales slowly.

```
                          STEVE
      I used his name so I wouldn’t have to give mine. It helped—felt like armor or something.
```

She looks at JARED, vulnerable now.

```
                          STEVE
      My real name is Jennifer.
```

---

Silence. STEVE shifts uncomfortably, clearly self-conscious. Her eyes avoid JARED’s.

JARED doesn’t speak. Instead, he offers a small, reassuring smile and leans slightly closer—still behind the wheel, still grounded.

STEVE exhales, shoulders slumping in quiet relief.

They sit like that for a while, the hum of the AC and the weight of what was said filling the space between them.
