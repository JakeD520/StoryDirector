# Story Extractor CLI

This is a Node.js command-line tool for extracting key story elements (themes, characters, settings, dialogue points, emotional contexts, genres, etc.) from a stream of thought using the OpenRouter API.

## Usage

1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies (to be added).
2. Start the CLI with:
   ```
   node index.js
   ```
   or, after linking:
   ```
   npx story-extractor
   ```
3. Follow the prompts to input your stream of thought.

## Next Steps
- Integrate OpenRouter API for language model processing.
- Add CLI input and output formatting.
